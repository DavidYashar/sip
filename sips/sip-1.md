## SIP: 1  Title: Spark Improvement Proposal Process  Author: Kevin Hurley  Status: Draft  Type: Informational  Created: 2025-04-03  Discussions-to: N/A

## Summary

This SIP defines the process for proposing, discussing, and implementing improvements to the Spark protocol.

## Motivation

A formal improvement proposal process ensures that changes to the Spark protocol are thoroughly vetted, documented, and implemented in a way that allows the community to participate in the evolution of Spark.

## Specification

### Types of SIPs

- **Standard SIPs**: Describe changes to the Spark protocol or new features that affect implementation or interfaces.  
  - **Core**: Changes to the core protocol.  
  - **Interface**: Changes to interfaces for interacting with Spark.  
- **Informational SIPs**: Provide guidelines, best practices, or information to the Spark community.

### SIP Lifecycle

1. **Idea**: Discuss your idea in the \[Spark forum or GitHub issues\] to gauge interest and feasibility.  
2. **Draft**: Create a pull request with your SIP document in the `sips/` directory.  
3. **Review**: The community and maintainers review the proposal, provide feedback, and suggest changes.  
4. **Accepted**: If consensus is reached, the SIP is accepted.  
5. **Implemented**: The proposed changes are implemented in the Spark codebase.  
6. **Final**: The SIP is marked as final once the implementation is complete and deployed.

### Required Sections for a SIP

Each SIP must include the following sections:

- **Preamble**: Headers containing metadata about the SIP.  
- **Summary**: A short description of the SIP.  
- **Motivation**: Why this change is necessary.  
- **Specification**: Detailed technical specification.  
- **Rationale**: Explanation of design decisions.  
- **Backwards Compatibility**: How the change affects existing functionality.  
- **Test Cases**: Examples or test scenarios.  
- **Reference Implementation**: Links to code or prototypes.  
- **Security Considerations**: Potential security implications.

### Submission Process

1. Fork the SIP repository.  
2. Copy the template to `sips/sip-<number>.md`.  
3. Fill in the required sections.  
4. Submit a pull request.  
5. Create a GitHub issue for discussion.

### Review Process

- SIPs are reviewed by the community and maintainers.  
- Feedback is provided via the pull request and associated issue.  
- The SIP may go through multiple revisions based on feedback.

### Decision Making

- Based on rough consensus among the community and final approval by the designated maintainers/committee

## Backwards Compatibility
